# Budget Tracker

## Application
Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

## User Story
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

## Bugs
I don't believe I ran into any bugs.
